    cd ECLARE
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    Create virtual environment
    ```bash
    python -m venv eclare_env
    ```

3. Activate virtual environment
    
    Windows
    ```bash
    eclare_env\Scripts\activate

    macOS and Linux
    ```bash 
    source eclare_env/bin/activate
    ```

    Git Bash on Windows
    ```bash
    source eclare_env/Scripts/activate
    ```


4. Install the package:
    For standard installation:

2. Edit `config.yaml` to suit your environment. Update paths and settings as necessary:

    ```yaml
    active_environment: "local_directories"

    local_directories:
      outpath: "/your/custom/output/path"
      datapath: "/your/custom/data/path"
    ```
